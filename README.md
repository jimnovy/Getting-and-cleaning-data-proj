# Class Project for "Getting and cleaning data"

This project's goal was to analyze the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and create a tidy data set based on the feature variables.

** Here are the steps to run the R script: **

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file.
3. Adjust the 4th line in the run_analysis.R file to set the working directory to the unzipped directory.

** Once these steps are complete you can run the script and recreate the data set. **

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidy.csv](tidy.csv).**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
